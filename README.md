# Spam-Classifier

Here, I will implement a spam classifier for the mailing system using Naive Bayes in Python.
Since it is naive, I'll be using sklearn.naive_bayes to train the spam classifier. Most of the code is just reading the data abd loading it into the Pandas dataframe. The ML classification bit is just few lines of code.
